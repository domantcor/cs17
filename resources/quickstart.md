this is the one and only guide you'll need to install and run the version of HLA you'll need for this course. since i personally use a m1 macbook running MacOS 14.0 as of writing this, i'm going to start with how to install and run a Windows virtual machine on MacOS since you can't natively run this version of HLA on MacOS (to my knowledge at least). if you already have one running, or are using a Windows computer, you can skip directly to the installation step in the table of contents below. if you don't understand any part of what i said, i'l recommend googling it before continuing past this point, since it only gets worse from here.
